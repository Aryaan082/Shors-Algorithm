# Shors Algorithm
In this repositroy, I want to take the oppertunity to describe Shor's algorithm, and the understanding that I have gotten from the code. I'm going to describe major code blocks to describe how the circuit works.

This code is based on the paper called, "Circuit for Shorâ€™s algorithm using 2n+3 qubits".

This is not my code. I was not able to write all the code for the algorithm by myself... it was too complicated. This code was not properly annotated and super confusing  so I will attempt to provide brief explanations for how it algorithm works.

## Block 1
This part just imports the files that will be needed for the circuit.
