# Shors-algorithm
In this repositroy, I want to take the oppertunity to describe Shor's algorithm, and the understanding that I have gotten from the code. I'm going to describe all of the major code blocks to describe how the circuit works to give you the number you are looking for.

I was not able to write all the code for the algorithm by myself... because it was too complicated, so I replicated the code. I will attempt to provide a similar in depth understanding to you for how the algorithm works.
